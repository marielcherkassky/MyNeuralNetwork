# MyNeuralNetwork
A simple neural network model 

This Model was part of an assignment that I was given during a DL course. The goal was to build a simple neural network class that supports
the backwards and forwarding functionality.

There are 3 examples that I added to the file : 
1.runSingleExample - Shows how to run a single instance through the model.
2.runBatchExample - Shows how to run a batch of instances through the model.
3.WorkOnRealDataExample - Shows how to handle a real data set - preparations before the training, and how to train the model in batch. 

*I attached a csv file that u you should use in the third example.
